        Due to the increased number of elective positions in Kenya, Kenyans
        waste a lot of valuable time browsing through google search results
        while searching for the names and details of their local and national
        representatives at the county and national level respectively .
        Therefore I would like to offer a solution, to help them find their
        ‘Mhesh’ with a single click.{" "}
      </p>
    </div>
